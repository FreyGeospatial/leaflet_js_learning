# leaflet_js_learning

I am using this repo to store and version control my test leaflet code.

Geotiffs and geojson files are not included here as of yet, as they are too large to store remotely. I may add sample geojsons at a later date.

For those interested in using this code, you should provide your own geotiffs.
